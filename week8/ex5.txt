A physical address is an address to a data that is currently presented in the physical memory.
A virtual address is a program-generated address to a data that is currently presented in the physical memory or not presented in the physical memory. If it is not, then the operating system loads it from other sources.
We cannot use physical addresses, instead, we are able to use virtual addresses that are maped to physical addresses in the Memory Management Unit if virtual memory is used.
