As we can see from results, creating more threads can decrease execution time in 3 times. 
But creating more threads doesn't make execution time lesser.
In my case, the execution time doesn't changes after adding more than 4 threads (only in my case, because my machine has four cores).
In compare previous task, the execution time is lesser.
